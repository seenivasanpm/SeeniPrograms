Initializing Semaphores
to initialise semphore use semctl(). 
	-	1st arg:  
	-	2nd arg:	0
	-	3rd arg:	SETALL
	-	4th	arg:	create a union semun on and point its array field at an array of unsigned short values.
semctl (semid, 0, SETALL, argument);
union semun {
int val;
struct semid_ds *buf;
unsigned short int *array;
struct seminfo *__buf;
};

union semun argument;


Wait and Post Operations
Each semaphore has a non-negative value and supports wait and post operations.
